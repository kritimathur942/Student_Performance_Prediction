## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting student grades using regression algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and deployment of the final model. The project showcases practical skills in Python programming, data manipulation, machine learning, and project structuring.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and prediction pipeline.
- `logs/`: Log files generated during the project execution.
- `models/`: Saved model files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-grade-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd student-grade-prediction`
3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended): `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the project workflow.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` notebook contains detailed exploratory data analysis, showcasing insights gained from the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries provide a deeper understanding of the data.

## Model Selection

The `notebooks/Model_Selection.ipynb` notebook focuses on training and evaluating various regression algorithms. The best-fit model is selected based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation performance.

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed on AWS for practical use. Details about the deployment process can be found in the `deployment/` directory.
